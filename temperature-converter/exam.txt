Create a Temperature Converter component, as shown below:







The component should have the following functionalities:



	It has 2 input number fields. The first is for a Celsius value, and the second is for a Fahrenheit value.


	Initially, both fields are empty.


	As a value is typed into the Celsius field, convert it to Fahrenheit and show it in the Fahrenheit field. Use the formula F = C*9/5 + 32 for conversion. In case of decimals, show up to 1 decimal value.


	As a value is typed into the Fahrenheit field, convert it to Celsius and show it in the Celsius field. Use the formula C = (F − 32) × 5/9 for conversion. In case of decimals, show up to 1 decimal value.





The following data-test-id attributes are required in the component for the tests to pass:



	The Celsius input should have the data-test-id attribute 'celsius-input'.


	The Fahrenheit input should have the data-test-id attribute 'fahrenheit-input'.





Please note that the component has the above data-test-id attributes for test cases and certain classes and ids for rendering purposes. It is advised not to change them.
