Create a Weather Details component, as shown below:

The component must have the following functionalities:

An array of objects is passed as a prop to the component, where each object is a weather record for a single city. The object has 4 properties:
  - name: The name of the city. [STRING]
  - temperature: The temperature in the city. [STRING]
  - wind: The wind in the city. [STRING]
  - humidity: The humidity in the city. [STRING]


There is an input field for the city name where the user can type the name of a city to search the weather data for. (The city name is case-insensitive.)

	If data exists for the typed input, render the weather details <div> as below, inside <div data-test-id="weather-details">.

		<span data-test-id="output-temperature">{temperature}</span>, where {temperature} is the value from the weather record.
		<div data-test-id="output-wind">Wind: {wind}</div>, where {wind} is the value from the weather record.
		<div data-test-id="output-humidity">Humidity: {humidity}</div>, where {humidity} is the value from the weather record.


	If no data exists for the typed input, do not render the weather details <div>, but instead render <div data-test-id="no-results">No Results Found</div>.

	At component render, since nothing is typed, do not render the above two <div> elements ("weather-details" and "no-results").

The following data-test-id attributes are required in the component for the tests to pass:
	The city name input should have the data-test-id attribute 'app-input'.
	The <div> containing weather details should have the data-test-id attribute 'weather-details'.
	The <span> containing the temperature should have the data-test-id attribute 'output-temperature'.
	The <div> containing the wind information should have the data-test-id attribute 'output-wind'.
	The <div> containing the humidity information should have the data-test-id attribute 'output-humidity'.
	The 'No Results Found' <div> should have the data-test-id attribute 'no-results'.

Please note that components have the above data-test-id attributes for test cases and certain classes and ids for rendering purposes. It is advised not to change them.
